I used to always think I was a relatively clean person. I usually always made sure to leave things where I knew it would always be, be relatively organised and try and make sure things like cables and such were always hidden.

It was only really this month that I was on holiday with somebody and was met with the comment "You're a little messy, aren't you?". I laughed it off, but I sort of realised that as I've become more busy in my life I've also become a little sloppy with other things (such as tidiness). To be clear; I do vacuum and clean, just not to the amount that I used to.

So, I came up with this idea: everyday, try to spend 10 minutes a day ticking off one thing off my todo list that I would normally push aside to do something I viewed as more important. They are more important, but these small things add up and end up getting in the way of the important things. My mind cannot focus with a bit of mess!

In a way, this methodology could be extended to just about anything in your life. Every great positive thing in your life was made with small positive steps, and vice versa. Let's keep moving in a more positive direction. 

After spending roughly 10 minutes a day doing small things such as organising, sorting out cables, scrubbing down surfaces etc. Things are looking a lot cleaner and I totally recommend it! ðŸ™‚
