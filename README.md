# Fantasy Fragments Blog

## ☯️ Source Code for My Personal Blog
This is all of the code I use for my personal blogsite that I post on. It's nothing particularly special, but I open sourced it anyway. Built with support from Astro documentation.


## 🗨️ A Blog Focused on Technology, Linguistics and Games
Interests stem in computer engineering, computer science, languages (predominantly western European, Mandarin and Japanese) and video games such as Touhou Project.

> In early development. Expect more on the way. Site is not currently hosted online.
